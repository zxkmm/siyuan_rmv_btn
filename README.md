It currently support removing top bar icons, side bar icons, and menus with id `commonMenu`, which are two icons on top right corner of each doc, and calling from the right side of each paragraph.    
# Warning
- If you removed too much items and end up stopped working, please go to your workspace and delete the entire ``siyuan_rmv_btn`` folder.
- The handler handle main interface of SiYuan as soon as DOM changes. In which case if you added too many items, the performance would be influenced.     
- This plugin didn't do extra work to prevent JS injection, in which case you should be more careful using it when in browser or hosted in public net.   
- If items you are trying to hide is related to SiYuan's commercial part, please consider to donate to @D and @V (not me) because they lives by writing open-source codes.    
- No garenteen for 3rd party themes.
